run_mapper
==========

R code for mapping .gpx files

Project idea and starting code borrowed from http://flowingdata.com/2014/02/05/where-people-run/

To use, clone the repo, create a data/ directory with all your .gpx files and an empty maps directory,
then open an R console in the source root, and run `source('run_mapper.R')`, followed by `make.plots()`.
